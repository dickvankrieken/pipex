# pipex

Pipex is a program that mimics the functionalities of the pipe operator that is used in shells of UNIX-like operating systems (like bash and zsh).

`$ cat test.txt | wc -l`

This will display the number of lines of the test.txt file to the terminal display.

Now the program wonâ€™t really be called by the pipe operator, but it will mimic its functionality as an executable program, written in the C programming language, that can be called as follows:

`$ ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`

which should do the same as

`$ < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2`
